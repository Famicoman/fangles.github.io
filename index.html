				<p id="virtuality">
					<strong>virtuality</strong>: The seeming of anything, as opposed to its reality. (This has been the dictionary meaning of "virtuality" since at least the 18th century).

The conceptual structure of all cars are the same, but the conceptual structure of every movie is different. The reality of a car is important, but the reality of a movie is unimportant--how a shot was made is of interest only to movie buffs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuality_(software_design)" target="_blank">[1]</a>
